<!-- not really sure what to put here, the mockup is just a blank page -->
Welcome to King of Stackers, a turn-based strategy game in which you must stack blocks
in neat rows. Doing so fills your opponent's field with random blocks, making it
harder for them to arrange their blocks. Twisting blocks into tight spaces, or stacking
a lot of rows at once, will put your opponent in greater jeopardy.
